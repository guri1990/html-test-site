      	  <h2> Etymology </h2>
      		<p> There is total lack of unanimity on how Mhow got its name. One possible source of the name might be the Mahua (Madhuca longifolia) tree, which grows in profusion in the forests around Mhow. </p>
      	   <p> Some articles in popular literature state that MHOW stands for Military Headquarters Of War. However, this is a backronym, and there is no proof to support the theory that the name of the village comes from the acronym. The village near Mhow was called Mhow Gaon in the pre-British era, when English was not used in India.</p>
      	   <p>In 2003, the town was renamed Dr. Ambedkar Nagar in honour of B. R. Ambedkar, who was born here. The renaming has not been without controversy. Many claim that it has been done due to the compulsions of vote bank politics. The new name is used for official purposes and has not been widely accepted</p>

      	 <article id = "article2" class="even">
      	  <h2> History </h2>
      	 <p> This cantonment town was founded in 1818 by John Malcolm as a result of the Treaty of Mandsaur between the English and the Holkars who were the Maratha Maharajas of Indore. </p>
      	 <p> Mhow used to be the headquarters of the 5th (Mhow) Division of the Southern Command during the British Raj.
      	 Mhow was a meter gauge railway district headquarters during the British Raj and even after 1947.[3] The irony is that Mhow finally has a broad gauge connection with Indore but regular train services are yet to commence.</p>
